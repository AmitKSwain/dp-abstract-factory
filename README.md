# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

Abstract Factory Design Pattern is a super-factory that creates other factories. It offers the interface for creating a family of related objects without explicitly specifying their classes.

Abstract Factory Design Pattern is used when we have two or more objects which works together forming a kit/set and there can be multiple sets or kits that can be created by client code. We separate client code from these concrete objects forming such a set and also from the code that creates such a set.
